          "content": "“Know thyself” is a timeless philosophical principle etched onto the ancient Greek Temple of Apollo in Delphi. These words had no meaning until I realized I don’t know that. Who am I? What is life? Am I living right? Am I good? Am I brave? Will I betray?\n\nI tried to find the source of myself, the roots, so to speak. And it turned out to dig it out I had to somehow fix the objective viewpoint.\n\nSo to apply the scientific method of self-discovery I had to assess my own behaviour in different situation. But staying objective towards oneself is really hard, you are inside. To make things easier I came up with the rule of life:\n\nDo not lie, especially to yourself.\n\nYou are the easiest people to fool. The Do Not Lie mantra has revealed itself as the bedrock of existence. It acts as an antidote to a psychic phenomenon Buddha identified as the ‘clinging’. We habitually dissect and classify every experience we undergo. Our minds grasp onto viewpoints, beliefs, and opinions. We adhere to customary rituals to the extent of fixation. Our bodies seek sensory gratification, craving stimuli for all five senses. In addition, there’s an odd lens that distorts our perception of ourselves. The mind sticks to everything, wants more, and whispers in our ear. Strangely it became obvious that I was wanting and doing things I regretted later.\n\nTo combat this I stopped lying completely. It felt a little strange at first, but in a good way. I stopped doing things I couldn’t later tell about. This already improved my life quite a bit. I stopped being involved in shady stories. I stopped keeping in mind what I said when. I stopped being afraid of being caught. I stopped being afraid of being judged. I stopped being afraid of being myself. I stopped being afraid of being.\n\nAfter such success I had to come up with the second rule to keep the professional life in order:\n\nDon’t deal with jerks.\n\nIf someone sets you up on small stuff, they will do it when shit hits the fan. You can’t totally avoid them. Sometimes they can be your co-workers and professionals. Just don’t get involved with them. And, because it is crucial to find the right people, someone you can trust, the flipside rule:\n\nDon’t be a jerk.\n\nDon’t lie. Don’t do stupid things. And the right people will see you. Those, who’s intentions are good, won’t be misunderstood. The rest will eventually fall off the wagon.\n\nOnce I came up with the rules, agreed with them, they became an essential part of the “me” framework. This is how I started to change myself. This triad had served well since.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Stop doing stupid things. Stop lying. Stop making things worse.\n  \n    — Jordan Peterson\n  \n\n\nI’ve since read numerous books on Psychology, Neurology, and Brain Functioning, digging for insights to fix and enrich life. It held more potential than I could imagine with my little brain. Over the next few years, I moved in self-discovery more than I had in my entire life before. I fixed myself.\n\nThe next turning point was the discovery of microdosing. Then the pace of events began to accelerate. A couple of years combined with contemplation and the exploration of Buddhism surpassed everything before. I recognized that Buddhism Psychology dealt with the same experiences and understanding of life that I had. It showed me that I am on the right path. And I’ve realized I can’t do anything for myself anymore. So I started improving lives around me.\n\nYou need to start pulling the thread of pull yourself out. Here is the guide on how to understand how to live your own life. I wish somebody had explained it to me. This is something they forgot to teach in the school and at home nobody knew what they are doing. I couldn’t find a book that encapsulated the essentials either. So, this is that book. This is what I wanted to hear when I was young. This is what I tell my kids. As it turns out, I had been holding it wrong. Life that is.\n\nTo start pulling it out you need to be asked the right questions. This is akin to Buddist Koans I never understood. It’s a kind of philosophical joke, usually a paradox, like “If the tree is falling and there is no one will it make a sound?”. This sounded ridiculous until I realized that the answer to this is not “Of course, we can record the sound”, it’s “Right, to perceive the sound vibration as a sound of a falling tree someone must hear it”. I wrote down the thoughts that will help.\n\nBuddha warned that you can’t save everyone, let’s help those who can be helped. This is what led me to a healthier, happier, and more mindful life. This is what worked.\n\nLet’s dive into understanding how we function and what we can about it. Join me on this journey of self-exploration. To uncover the source of sustainable joy in our lives.\n\nEvery journey starts with a single step. Let’s try a simple question:\n\nWho are you?"

          "content": "Which part of your being defines “you”? Is it solely your physical form?\n\nIf you were to lose an arm, would you be any less “you”?\n\nOr is it perhaps the awe-inspiring wonder that is your brain, a marvel in its own right?\n\nWhen one passes away the physical structure of the brain remains unaltered, holding the memories and knowledge amassed over a lifetime. \nYet we can’t say by brain scans did the person knew English? Could they ride a bicycle?\n\nConsciousness, that unique essence we often refer to as “I” fades into the background.\nAs if the vibrant orchestra of the mind falls silent.\n\nThe essence of life, your true self, doesn’t reside within the intricate network of neurons or the matter of the brain itself. \nIt thrives in the intangible spaces between those neurons, in the ethereal connections that define the essence of your existence. \nIt is in this ineffable realm that your consciousness truly resides, giving life its rich tapestry of thoughts, emotions, and experiences.\n\nIt is the profound electrochemical reaction, an ethereal flame that courses within. \nThat is the true essence of your being.\n\nIt is this internal spark that illuminates your existence.\n\nHow come we know very little about ourselves?\n\n\nOur body is formed before we appear. It lives and functions before a consciousness emerges within it. \nBefore we come into being. We step into a fully operational vehicle.\n\nHow do you become aware of something that has existed since before you were born? \nStrangely, we often overlook our very own body, despite it being our constant companion. A solitary cell that we inhabit since the very beginning.\n\nThe sixth sense\n\n\nWe know the basic five senses: Vision, Taste, Touch, Hear, and Smell. \nIn Buddhism, they consider the sixth sense – The Mind or consciousness itself. \nThe mind is regarded as the sixth sense because it is the primary means through which we experience and interact with the world.\n\nBuddhist teachings emphasize the importance of understanding and mastering the mind to develop greater insight, clarity, and wisdom.\n\nBut wait, what are those?\n\n\nTurns out we sense a lot more. Balance, Temperature, Pain, Position. The body is constantly sending us signals. Where are our limbs? Are we moving? Are we falling? Is it cold? Where is up?\n\n\n\nStretch, Pressure, Vasolidation, Acceleration… The list goes on. Some researches agree on 21 senses, some go up to 53. One this is certain, though. We are always connected to this endless stream of body signals. This has started before we were born, before we become aware of ourselves, we don’t even notice it anymore.\n\nOur sense of self is closely tied to our physical body. We are blind wisemen in out bodies trying to comprehend an elephant in a dark room. \nIs it like a rope, a wall, or a tree? We touch the world around us with all our senses.\n\n\n  “Sensation is the raw material of consciousness. Perception is the finished product of sensation. Knowledge is the result of perception. Wisdom is the culmination of knowledge.” - Idries Shah\n\n\nBut, okay, it is what it is, we feel the world around us, one way or another. Can we even trust our perception?"

Yep. You just scan the lines and the brain gives you the whole words. \nImportant here is that you can feel it’s easier to read if you aren’t even trying. \nBecause something in your body is doing that for you.

The modern humans appeared in the last seconds of the last minute.\n\n\n  Formation of Earth: 00:00 (4.5 billion years ago)\n  First Life Forms (Prokaryotes): 01:15 (3.5 billion years ago)\n  Photosynthesizing Organisms: 02:00 (3 billion years ago)\n  Oxygenation of Atmosphere: 03:30 (2.4 billion years ago)\n  Complex Cells (First Eukaryotes): 04:45 (2 billion years ago)\n  Multicellular Life: 06:45 (1 billion years ago)\n  First Animals: 08:00 (600 million years ago)\n  Diverse Marine Life (Cambrian Explosion): 08:30 (540 million years ago)\n  First Land Plants: 09:45 (470 million years ago)\n  Dinosaurs: 11:15 (230 million years ago)\n  Dinosaurs Wiped Out: 12:45 (65 million years ago)\n  Early Human Ancestors: 14:30 (6-7 million years ago)\n  Modern Humans (Homo sapiens) Emerged: 17:45 (300,000 years ago)\n  The Last Ice Age: Ended around 11,700 years ago (23:59:48).\n\n\nThe whole dinosaur civilization was wiped out in about an hour and a half. And we just got here.\n\nThe tree of Life\n\nLook at this beautiful chart. There is also an interactive version.\n\n\n\n\n  Life on Eearth is one big extended family! Every human being is related genealogically not just to all other humans, but to all other living things. And not only organisms living today, but to everything that has ever lived.\n\n\nThe fact of life is we not only have common ancestors. We are related closer than one might think.\nThis also applies to the evolution of our brain. We have common brain structures and behaviours as well.\n\nUnlike animals, the newborn doesn&#8217;t recognize mother&#8217;s face, voice, or feel fear, nor do they understand dangers. This difference can be explained by the anatomy of the brain and the embryo&#8217;s developmental history. These science shows that a baby&#8217;s brain is far from being as developed at the time of birth as an animal&#8217;s brain. Out of the vast number of nerve cells, only a very few are fully developed when a child is born. The majority are underdeveloped and incapable of functioning."

The replitian brain, the monkey brain and the human brain.\n\nThey all work in unison and the human baby grows through all phases.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Reptilian Brain (Brainstem): This is the most primitive part of our brain, often referred to as the &#8220;reptilian brain&#8221; because it&#8217;s similar to the brain structure found in reptiles. It&#8217;s responsible for basic survival instincts like aggression, dominance, territoriality, and the fight-or-flight response. This part of the brain is associated with our most fundamental needs and instincts.\n  \n  \n    Monkey Brain (Limbic System): This is the next evolutionary stage and is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;monkey brain&#8221; because it&#8217;s similar to the brain structure found in mammals. It&#8217;s primarily responsible for emotions, memory, and social interactions. This part of the brain allows for more complex behaviors and responses compared to the reptilian brain.\n  \n  \n    Human Brain (Neocortex): This is the most recent evolutionary addition and is what distinguishes us from other animals. It&#8217;s sometimes called the &#8220;human brain&#8221; or the &#8220;thinking brain&#8221;. This part of the brain is responsible for advanced cognitive functions such as logic, reason, language, problem-solving, and abstract thinking. It&#8217;s what enables us to plan, innovate, and create complex societies.\n  \n\n\nDuring the development of a human baby, these three parts of the brain go through various stages of growth and maturation. The reptilian brain is crucial for basic survival instincts in early stages of life. The monkey brain develops as the child starts to interact with their environment and other people, experiencing emotions and forming memories. Finally, the human brain, particularly the neocortex, undergoes significant development as the child grows, allowing for higher-level thinking and complex cognitive functions.\n\nIn essence, these three parts of the brain work together in a seamless manner, each contributing to different aspects of our behavior and cognition. This layered evolution is a testament to the complexity and sophistication of the human brain."

It’s universal and needs no explanation. It’s the reason even a single-celled organism seeks nourishment, and it’s what compels a plant to reach for the sunlight. The love for life is often expressed as a deep-seated instinct to protect oneself, to seek out nourishment, and to form connections with others.\n\nInterestingly, it’s often the little ones, both human and animal, who seem to feel and revel in this love for life most profoundly. It’s the reactor that powers our lives. It’s a pity that somewhere along the journey, that vibrant inner light begins to dim. This is why I am writing these words. It’s always easier to prevent.\n\n\n\nThis primal emotion is the foundation upon which all other feelings and behaviors are built. It’s the source of our vitality, our resilience, and our innate drive to persevere through challenges. Even in the face of adversity, this love for life fuels our determination to overcome obstacles and find meaning in our existence.\n\nIn essence, it’s the heartbeat of life itself, echoing through every living being, reminding us of the preciousness and value inherent in every moment of our existence. Without that innate love for life, our journey on Earth would lose its meaning, what’s the point of suffering all the time.

And sends signals upward to the next level.\n\n\n\nThe reptile in us ensures that we feed, protect ourselves, and pass on our genetic legacy to the next generation. This primal force is the bedrock of our existence, the instinctual beat that keeps us tethered to life.\n\nThis middle level, known as the limbic system, acts as an analyzer and organizer. It receives the signals from the lower department and assesses if there&#8217;s any real danger. If not, it calmly processes the information, puts things in their place, and files them away for future reference.\n\n\n\nThe monkey carefully observes the patterns of the world around us, weaving together threads of understanding and insight. It keeps us together allowing us to form bonds, work and build civilizations.\n\nBut what truly sets us apart as humans is the top-level department, the neocortex. This is where you, the boss, reside. It&#8217;s the realm of dreams, creativity, and the abstract thinking.

It’s a primal instinct, an alert system wired into our biology over millions of years. Even though a bacterium doesn’t possess consciousness or feelings, it has an inbuilt mechanism that guides it away from harmful environments. This instinct for self-preservation is the very foundation upon which the tapestry of life is woven.\n\n\n\nIt emerges from the deepest layers of our nervous system. This primal emotion arises from our reptilian brain, the ancient guardian of survival. Then it travels via the neural pathways through the limbic system. There fear gets mixed and blended with various hues and other signals.\n\nFear takes on different forms. It becomes greed, the insatiable appetite for more. It transforms into envy, longing for what others possess. It morphs into jealousy, guarding what we believe is rightfully ours. In the grand gallery of human emotions, fear is both the canvas and the hidden brushstroke that gives depth and complexity to our inner world.\n\nEssentially it is pulling us back, limiting our options. It whispers into our ears:\n\n— You are not going to make. It’s too risky. They will laugh. They are going to judge you. You don’t need it. Everything is fine.\n\nAnd instead of creating our lives we sit with an anxious heart, literally paralyzed by imaginary troubles of the unknown waves yet to come.\n\n\n\nThus, we find ourselves suspended between what’s to come and what’s already been, yearning for control over tides we can’t predict or reverse. We seek solace and purpose. While navigating the waters of life with the hope that we’ll find our way.\n\n\n  “I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened.” — Mark Twain\n\n\nIn the absence of actual fear, we construct more intricate emotions rooted in fear. Greed arises is the fear of loss, jealousy is the fear of not being loved, and envy is the fear of not being “enough”. In the end, we are afraid of the fear itself.\n\nWe cry wolf, but the wolf never comes."

In fact there is an issue, the chronic stress literally shrinks your brain.\n\n\n\nWhen you’re stressed, your body releases cortisol, often called the ‘stress hormone.’ In small doses, it does some important jobs. It helps regulate blood pressure, keeps blood sugar steady, and reduces inflammation. Our bodies have a natural response to stress, and cortisol steps in as the main player. Think of it as the body’s way of gearing up to face a challenge.\n\nBut here’s the catch. When stress becomes a constant, cortisol levels stay high for longer periods. This prolonged exposure starts reshaping our brain, and not in a good way. Specifically, it leads to a shrinkage of certain brain areas. Two regions that take a hit are the hippocampus, which is like our brain’s librarian, overseeing memory and learning, and the prefrontal cortex, the wise conductor of our thoughts, emotions, and actions. You can think of them as essential command centers.\n\nChronic stress doesn’t just play havoc with our emotions. It makes learning, remembering, and decision-making tougher. It’s a bit like a muscle that weakens without regular exercise. In this case, it’s the structural integrity of our brain that’s at stake.\n\nBasically you devolve back into a monkey. That’s why easing the existential fear is the most effective way of getting rid of stress. It isn’t just a luxury — it’s a necessity for our well-being and brainpower."

          "content": "The so called “Flammarion engraving” is a famous woodcut illustration that first appeared in Camille Flammarion’s book “L’atmosphère: météorologie populaire” (The Atmosphere: Popular Meteorology) in 1888. The illustration depicts a medieval scholar, often interpreted as Flammarion himself, reaching through the outermost celestial sphere to observe the mysteries beyond.\n\nA naïve missionary of the Middle Ages even tells us that, in one of his voyages in search of the terrestrial paradise, he reached the horizon where the earth and the heavens met, and that he discovered a certain point where they were not joined together, and where, by stooping his shoulders, he passed under the roof of the heavens.\n\nThis engraving has become an iconic representation of the human quest for knowledge and the exploration of the unknown. It’s often used in discussions about the limits of human understanding, the pursuit of truth, and the idea that there are realms of knowledge yet to be discovered.\n\nThe engraving has also been adopted in various contexts, including popular culture, where it’s sometimes used to represent themes of curiosity, exploration, and the search for deeper meaning.\n\nBefore tearing the fabric of reality let’s see how much we know about it. Our main sensory organ — the brain is not giving us a complete picture. We are always confined withing our senses and understanding.\n\nOur sensory organs (eyes, ears, nose, skin, and tongue) can only detect a certain range of stimuli. We see only a range of colors within the electromagnetic spectrum, hear a certain range of frequencies, and so on.\n\n\n\nOur brains process sensory information and make assumptions based on prior experiences. This leads to misinterpretations and illusions. And we miss out on details of events happening outside our attention.\n\nReality is a web of intricate systems and phenomena. Everything is interlinked in ways we can scarcely imagine.\n\nIt is a constant flow, making it impossible to pin down. Our senses and cognition can’t fully capture the depth and breadth of reality. At the subatomic level, particles defy our usual understanding of existence. The universe likely extends far beyond what our senses can fathom.\n\nPerspectives vary, each individual experiences and interprets reality uniquely. Concepts like time dilation and quantum entanglement defy logic as we know it. Our sensory perception is limited, we’re seeing only a fraction of a vast landscape. Recognizing the vastness of what we don’t know is a mark of wisdom.\n\nOur perception provides us with a subjective, filtered version of reality. It’s a constructed representation that allows us to navigate and interact with the world, but it’s not an exhaustive view of objective reality.\n\nEverything we experience come through three lenses:\n\n\n  Sensory: This is our senses, shaping how we perceive the world around us.\n  Socio-cultural: This lens is created from our environment. It is the cultural and historical context in which we live.\n  Individual: This lens is unique to each person. It is their personal history, experiences, and perspective.\n\n\nThe ultimate reality is inconceivable. We are experiencing only a tiny sliver of it. And to pack what’s going in our heads, we are telling ourselves stories about who we are and what we do."

          "content": "Science is a systematic approach to understanding the world around us. We use science to observe, measure, experiment, and formulate theories about the natural phenomena we encounter. This scientific method allows us to study the tangible aspects of reality, the things we can touch, see, and measure.\n\nChristianity played a significant role in the development of science in the West. During the Middle Ages, Christian thinkers were driven by a desire to understand the intricacies of God&#8217;s creation. They believed that by studying the natural world, they were uncovering the workings of the Divine. This perspective led to a surge in scientific inquiry.\n\nScholars believed that by uncovering the basic elements of creation, they were peering into the mind of God. This philosophical backdrop provided a fertile ground for the growth of modern science, encouraging scientists to delve deeper into the mysteries of the universe.\n\nBut this is just the world of things, where the action take place. It&#8217;s a backdrop for the game that takes place in our heads. We construct personal narratives or myths to make sense of our lives as we go along. We always tell ourslves stories about who we are and what we do.\n\nWe are all storytellers, crafting narratives that we think might help us navigate the complexities of life. These stories are not fictional. This is our interpretation of reality. The most important is what myths we are telling ourselves about what is going on. What are we doing? Are we winning?\n\nThose stories unfold in a fictional space in our heads which is a reflection of the world around us. But as we know reality is much more than we can comprehend. So we pack the parts of it into the mind map in our head. The map of meaning.\n\nWhile science aims to measure and explain the tangible world of things, the map of meaning is a more abstract construct. Unlike scientific maps that chart physical territory, maps of meaning chart the psychological and emotional terrain of our inner world.\n\n\n  Ask yourself: What do you believe is going on in you life right now?\n\n\nA person&#8217;s map of meaning is constructed from a blend of personal experiences, cultural narratives, and philosophical views. It incorporates elements from their upbringing, background, beliefs, and personal reflections. It shapes how we interpret events, assign meaning to experiences, and define our values. It steers the story we tell ourselves. What do you believe is going on right now?\n\nScience deals with empirical evidence and observable phenomena. The map of meaning grapple with abstract concepts like purpose, morality, and the nature of existence. They help us make sense of the human condition, providing a framework for understanding why we&#8217;re here and what we&#8217;re meant to do. This is where religion, philosophy, and personal introspection come into play. These maps are essential for navigating the complexities of life beyond the physical realm.\n\nAa map of meaning might help an individual find purpose in their work, relationships, or personal pursuits. It offers solace in times of adversity, providing a sense of direction and a framework for understanding life&#8217;s challenges."

This is the physical vessel that houses us. It&#8217;s a vehicle that we use to enter the physical world. The exoskeleton for the mind. The body interacts with the external environment, experiences sensations, and carries out survival functions. The body has it&#8217;s own intelligence. It is controlled by the Reptile Brain structures, with the help of the spinal cord. It is capable of acting independently not letting you hurt yourself.\n  Mind: It encompasses our thoughts, emotions, perceptions, and cognitive functions. It&#8217;s the seat of our consciousness and intelligence. The mind interprets the external world, processes information, and influences our behavior. And it&#8217;s plugged into the body directly. Whatever happens in the body, the mind is aware of it. This is the part of you that thinks, feels, and experiences the world. It is controlled by the Monkey Brain. It is capable of acting independently not letting you hurt yourself.\n  Soul: The spiritual essence, the soul is seen as the eternal, unchanging core of a person. It&#8217;s associated with deeper meanings, purpose, and a sense of connection to something greater than oneself. The soul is what believed to transcend the physical realm. It is what we mean by consciousness, identity, I. This is the real you.\n\n\n\n\nImagine yourself as a walking human-shaped flower pot. Inside this pot, there&#8217;s a beautiful, vibrant flower, which represents your soul - the true essence of who you are. Your soul dwells in your body, experiencing and interacting with the world. The brain is the soil, the soul lives in the neural pathways between the cells.\n\nThe body provides it with the means to interact with the external world. It holds and nurtures the flower. The flower, your soul, is what gives you life, consciousness, and identity. It&#8217;s the part of you that feels, thinks, and experiences the world in a personal way.\n\nJust as a flower needs care, sunlight, and nourishment to blossom, your soul needs the right conditions to flourish. Not just taking care of your physical health, but also nurturing your emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being. When all these aspects are in harmony, the flower is blooming in its perfect pot.\n\nYour task in this world is to cradle and support the flower of your soul. Water it with emotions. It&#8217;s a unique and intricate relationship that defines your existence and shapes your experience of the world.\n\nBut somehow instead of flying like fairies we&#8217;re crippled by anxiety an everyday stress.

We are always sizing ourselves and everybody up, comparing how we are doing and automatically filling in the pre-defined place. We are always in a hierarchy of some kind.\n\n\n\nMaslow’s pyramid is a well-known blueprint that outlines of human needs and motivations. It’s a visual representation of the steps we take to meet our various needs, starting from the most basic ones at the bottom, and progressing upwards.\n\nThe top of the pyramid, shown within the triangle, exists beyond the confines of the pyramid itself. It’s the way out. To be on the top actually means to be outside of it. The originally white Egyptian pyramids had a golden capstone. Which symbolize the transcendence to a higher plane. The white base represented the earthly realm and the struggles of mortal life, while the golden top signifies the the divine.\n\n\n  The mountains you are carrying you’re only supposed to climb.\n\n  ― Najwa Zebian\n\n\nAnd it is the same with the Maslow’s pyramid. The ultimate state of self-actualization lies outside the scope of the needs and motivations outlined within the pyramid. It’s a higher plane of existence, transcending the framework altogether.\n\nThe main goal in life isn’t just to navigate the stairs moping around merely satisfying basic requirements. The goal is to breaking free from the cycle. Do not be imprisoned for life. Close your holes, mend what’s broken, get out of it, and never come back. Transcend it – ascend to a higher place of existence. Self-realization is the closest we come to the divine.\n\nThe pyramids are a symbol of eternity, just like the world itself. And they are towering around us all as, we always in of hierarchy or another. We always measure, compare and analyze ourselves and the others. Leave one pyramid you find yourself in another. They go way up endlessly nested and connected. You will never be on the top of them all. Close your holes and get out of the one you are in.\n\n\n  It’s turtles all the way down.\n\n  — Terry Pratchett\n\n\nLook closer and you will see that down below are the bottomless depths of meaning. Imagine a deep well. As you peer into it, you realize it stretching further than the eye can see. Each layer you uncover, each bit of understanding, only reveals more layers beneath it. Each layer of knowledge is within another, never ending. There is no bottom. “It’s turtles all the way down!”\n\nDon’t let yourself be trapped in the endless cycle of hierarchies. Don’t participate and get out of the one you are in."

They often seek sympathy and support from others.\n  \n  \n    Persecutor: This role is taken on by someone who criticizes, blames, or attacks the Victim. They may appear aggressive or domineering.\n  \n  \n    Rescuer: The Rescuer attempts to help or protect the Victim from the Persecutor. They often do so with the intention of feeling needed or superior.\n  \n\n\nThis dynamic tends to cycle, with individuals switching roles. A Victim might eventually become a Persecutor or Rescuer in a different situation.\n\nRecognizing this pattern is crucial because it can lead to unhealthy and unproductive relationships. Aim for healthier dynamics where people communicate openly, take responsibility for their actions, and seek mutual understanding.

It’s about how to be free. Happiness is a byproduct of freedom. Freedom is a byproduct of self-awareness. Self-awareness is a result of a forward thinking. Which is a habit that thinking forward forms.\n\nBy thinking forward I mean not holding yourself back with every phrase. Not adding the brake liquid. No “but”, “however”, and other anchors pulling back. To reach this state you have to be aware of your thoughts and emotions.  You have to be aware of what’s going on in your head.\n\nProblem is the head is attached to your body and whatever you think you want — you’re not in control.\n\n\n\nThere are many jokes about not seeing what’s right in front of you. It’s funny because it’s true. We are so busy with our thoughts and at the same time we’re so perplexed by the outside, we stop seeing what’s really happening both around and inside us.\n\nIf you feel that life is not going the way you wanted. I propose to simply fix that. It works for those willing to change. In Buddhism, teachers and guides can provide guidance and teachings, the actual progress on the path is ultimately the responsibility of the individual.

I couldn’t stop thinking about his words and I had some insights by the end of the day.\n\n\n\n\nThis is what I’ve heard in this performance. Here are the parts that resonated the most.\n\n\n  I used to believe that who I was ended at the edge of my skin, that I had been given this little vehicle called a body from which to experience creation. And though I couldn’t have asked for a sportier model, it was after all a loner and would have to be returned. Then I learned that everything outside the vehicle was part of me too, and now I drive a convertible. Top down, wind in my hair.\n\n\nThere is no other way to live life as full face forward. It’s like diving out of the plane with no gear. You know how it’s going to end, so let’s enjoy it.\n\n\n  You have given them the ability to walk behind the mind’s elaborate set decoration and to see that there’s a huge difference between a dog that is going to eat you in your mind and an actual dog that is going to eat you.\n\n  That may sound like no big deal, but many never learned that distinction. And they spend a great deal of their lives living in fight or flight response.\n\n\nSo many things we never do because even scared to try.\n\n\n  Now fear is going to be a player in your life, but you get to decide how much. You can spend your whole life imagining ghosts, worrying about the pathway to the future, but all there will ever be is what’s happening here, and the decisions we make in this moment, which are based in either love or fear. So many of us choose our path out of fear disguised as practicality.\n\n\nThink about it, everything except joy and love is made out fear.\n\n“fear disguised as practicality”\n\nAnd I love this bit, the universe favor those who want more:\n\n\n  What we really want seems impossibly out of reach and ridiculous to expect. So we never dare to ask the universe for it. I’m saying I’m the proof that you can ask the universe for it. Please. And if it doesn’t happen for you right away, it’s only because the universe is so busy fulfilling my order.\n\n\nSomething about job safety and relying on external forces out of your control:\n\n\n  My father could have been a great comedian, but he didn’t believe that that was possible for him. And so he made a conservative choice. Instead, he got a safe job as an accountant. And when I was 12 years old, he was let go from that safe job and our family had to do whatever we could to survive.\n\n\nAbout doing what you love:\n\n\n  I learned many great lessons from my father, not the least of which was that you can fail at what you don’t want so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.\n\n\nThose lovely words about his father:\n\n\n  It’s not the only thing he taught me though. I watched the effect of my father’s love and humor and how it altered the world around me.\n\n\nHow’s the water? Think about the effect you have on others:\n\n\n  As someone who’s done what you’re about to go and do, I can tell you from experience the effect you have on others is the most valuable currency there is. Because everything you gain in life will rot and fall apart, and all that will be left of you is what was in your heart.\n\n\nAnd the effect others have on you:\n\n\n  Your need for acceptance can make you invisible in this world. Don’t let anything stand in the way of the light that shines through this form. Risk being seen in all of your glory.\n\n\nAnd this just hit the nail on my head, YES! Life is a gift to you and it is for mining joy.\n\n\n  Like many of you, I was concerned about going out into the world and doing something bigger than myself, until someone smarter than myself made me realize that there is nothing bigger than myself. My soul is not contained within the limits of my body. My body is contained within the limitlessness of my soul. One unified field. One unified field of nothing dancing for no particular reason, except maybe to comfort and entertain itself.\n\n\nExactly, reset every second. So you can only think forward:\n\n\n  As that shift happens in you, you won’t be feeling the world, you’ll be felt by it. You’ll be embraced by it. Now I’m always at the beginning, I have a reset button and I ride that button constantly. Once that button is functioning in your life, there’s no story that the mind could create that will be as compelling. The imagination is always manufacturing scenarios, both good and bad. And the ego tries to keep you trapped in the multiplex of the mind. Our eyes are not viewers. They’re also projectors that are running a second story over the picture that we see in front of us all the time. Fear is writing that script, and the working title is I’ll Never be Enough.\n\n\nAnd this is the best important part:\n\n\n  And after you walk through those doors today, you will only ever have two choices, love or fear. Choose love, and don’t ever let fear turn you against your playful heart.\n\n\nFull Transcript"

          "content": "Наткнулся на это преобразовывающий сознание спич утром. Джим Керри знает что говорит. Еще один кусочек паззла, подсказывающий, что я на верном пути. Весь день думал о его словах, про выбор, который мы делаем от страха. И к концу дня испеклись новые инсайты, стало яснее что делать дальше.\n\n\n\n\nВот что я услышал в этом выступлении, это не спич, он там и картину свою показал. Переведу части, которые меня больше всего тронули.\n\n\n  Раньше я считал, что то, кем я являюсь, заканчивается на краю моей кожи, что мне было дано это маленькое средство под названием тело, чтобы пережить создание. И я не просил даже более спортивной модели, какая разница, ее придется вернуть. Потом я узнал, что все что снаружи это тоже часть меня, и теперь я вожу кабриолет. Крыша открыта, ветер развевает волосы.\n\n\nДругого способа жить полной жизнью просто нет. Это как прыжок с парашютом без снаряжения. Ты знаешь, как это закончится. Живешь в прыжке.\n\n\n  Способность пройти за кулисы сложной декорации ума и увидеть, что есть огромная разница между собакой, которая собирается вас укусить в вашем уме, и настоящей собакой, которая собирается это сделать.\n\n  Это может показаться мелочью, но многие так и не научаться отличать одно от другого. Они свою жизни в постоянной реакции борьбы или бегства.\n\n\nТак много вещей, которые мы никогда не делаем, потому что боимся даже пробовать.\n\n\n  Страх будет всегда игроком в вашей жизни, но вы решите, насколько сильна его роль. Вы можете провести всю жизнь воображая ужасы, беспокоясь о пути в будущее, но все, что когда-либо было и будет, - это то, что происходит сейчас. И решения, которые мы принимаем в этот момент, основаны либо на любви, либо на страхе. Многие из нас выбирают свой путь из страха, прикидываясь практичностью.\n\n\nПодумайте об этом. Все кроме радости и любви сделано из страха.\n\n“Страх, прикидывающийся практичностью”\n\nИ мне нравится этот момент, вселенная помогает тем, кто хочет больше:\n\n\n  То, что мы действительно хотим, кажется невероятно далеким и смешным, чтобы ожидать. Так что мы никогда не осмеливаемся просить у вселенной. Я доказательство того, что вы можете просить. Пожалуйста. И если это не произойдет сразу, это только потому, что вселенная занята выполнением моего заказа.\n\n\nЧто-то о безопасности работы и полагание на внешние силы, которые не поддаются вашему контролю:\n\n\n  Мой отец мог бы стать великим комиком, но он не верил, что это возможно. И поэтому он сделал консервативный выбор. Надеюжную работу бухгалтера. Когда мне было 12 лет, его уволили с этой надежной работы, и нашей семье пришлось делать все, что мы могли, чтобы выжить.\n\n\nО том, чтобы заниматься тем, что ты любишь:\n\n\n  Я получил много уроков от своего отца, не последний из них тот, что раз уж можно потерпеть неудачу в том, чего вы не хотите, то можно смело попробовать заняться тем, что вы любите.\n\n\nЭти замечательные слова о его отце:\n\n\n  Но это не единственное, что он меня научил. Я видел, как влияние любви и юмора моего отца меняло мир вокруг меня.\n\n\nКак водичка? Подумайте о том, какое воздействие вы оказываете на других:\n\n\n  Как тот, кто сделал то, что вы собираетесь сейчас сделать, я могу сказать вам из опыта, что воздействие, которое вы оказываете на других, - это самая ценная валюта, которая существует. Потому что все, что вы получаете в жизни, исчезнет и распадется, и все, что останется от вас, - это то, что было в вашем сердце.\n\n\nИ воздействие, которое другие оказывают на вас:\n\n\n  Ваша потребность в признании может сделать вас невидимыми в этом мире. Не дайте ничему стоять на пути света, который сияет через эту форму. Рискните быть увиденными во всей своей славе.\n\n\nИ это прям последний гвоздь. ДА! Жизнь - подарок тебе, и она предназначена для того, чтобы добывать радость.\n\n\n  Как и многие из вас, меня беспокоило то, что я иду в мир и делаю что-то большее, чем сам. Пока кто-то умнее меня не заставил меня понять, что нет ничего большего меня. Моя душа не заключена в пределах моего тела. Мое тело находится в пределах бесконечности моей души. Одно единое поле. Одно единое поле ничего, танцующее ради ни в чем не нужной причины, кроме, возможно, утешения и развлечения самой себя.\n\n\nТочно так, think forward, думай вперед. Сброс каждую секунду.\n\n\n  Когда этот сдвиг происходит в вас, вы не будете чувствовать мир, мир будет чувствовать вас. Вы будете обняты им. Теперь я всегда на старте, у меня есть кнопка сброса, и я нажимаю эту кнопку постоянно. Как только эта кнопка начинает работать в вашей жизни, нет ни одной истории, которую разум может создать, что было бы таким убедительным. Воображение всегда создает сценарии, как хорошие, так и плохие. И эго пытается удержать вас в кинотеатре ума. Наши глаза не являются только зрителями. Они также проекторы, которые запускают вторую историю над изображением, которое мы видим перед собой все время. Страх пишет этот сценарий, и рабочее название - Я никогда не буду достаточно хорош.\n\n\nА это самая важная часть:\n\n\n  И после того как вы переступите через эти двери сегодня, у вас будет всего два выбора: любовь или страх. Выбирайте любовь и никогда не позволяйте страху обратить вас против вашего игривого сердца.\n\n\nПолный текст"

          "content": "A story from a friend. Tells you something about the capabilities of the brain. A person literally managed to finalize a thought. To hold onto it, and not let himself to spill the attention over.\n\n\n  I can&#8217;t help but share a story about the potential of our brain. Recently, I found myself at the Kapitsa Institute&#8217;s Physics and Technology Lyceum (https://anoo.ftl.name). The vice-rector who welcomed and showed us around shared an interesting story.\n\n  A student stopped communicating with the outside world for two months: he was late for classes, got confused in classrooms, and didn&#8217;t react to his surroundings. The school started to worry, sought out psychologists to assess the situation. And then he started talking to them in Georgian.\n\n  Turns out he noticed some similarities in the shape of Georgian alphabet with some ancient text (I think about astronomy, but I&#8217;m not sure). He developed his theory on this matter and, to prove it, decided to learn Georgian. In these 2 months, he learned it independently, without telling anyone.\n\n  He simultaneously engaged in three cognitive processes: in they first - he continued to study at the lyceum with a serious program, in the second - he was developing his theory, and in the third - he was independently learning Georgian. The energy drain was so high, he had to completely disconnect from the outside world. And he made it through admirably.\n\n\nI&#8217;m familiar with a similar state, where you go deeper and hardly communicate with the surface. The fact that there are additional actions to perform outside aside from the main goal helps to not get stretched and only do what&#8217;s important. But you can&#8217;t stay underwater for long. After the brain gets tired, you start making all sorts of nonsense, without even realizing it. You can&#8217;t afford to get tired, it always had to payed back with interest."

          "content": "История из чата. О возможнотях мозга. Человеку в прямом смысле слова удалось додумать мысль. Удержать, и не расплескать себя.\n\n\n  Не могу не поделиться историей о возможностях нашего мозга. Недавно я оказалась в лицее физико-технического института имени Капицы (https://anoo.ftl.name). Проректор, которая нас встречала и показывала нам всё, рассказала интересную историю.\n\n  Один ученик перестал общаться с внешним миром в течение 2 месяцев: опаздывал на уроки, ошибался в кабинетах, никак не реагировал на окружение. Школа начала волноваться, искала психологов и обдумывала, что делать с этой ситуацией. И вот тогда он начал разговаривать с ними на грузинском языке.\n\n\n\n  Оказалось, что он заметил некоторые сходства в написании букв грузинского алфавита с каким-то древним трактатом (по-моему, об астрономии, но я не уверена). Он разработал свою теорию на этот счет и, чтобы её доказать, решил выучить грузинский язык. За эти 2 месяца он выучил его самостоятельно, никому об этом не рассказав.\n\n\n\n  Проректор рассказывала эту историю с эмоциями в голосе, сказав, что у него одновременно шло 3 когнитивных процесса: в первом - он продолжал обучаться в лицее по серьезной программе, во втором - он разрабатывал свою теорию, а в третьем - самостоятельно учил грузинский язык. Энергозатраты были такие, что ему пришлось полностью отключиться от внешнего мира. И он справился с этим вполне успешно.\n\n\nПодобное состояние мне знакомо. Ты уходишь, как бы, на глубину и не общаешься с поверхностью. То, что приходится совершать какие-то действия помимо основной цели, помогает не распыляться и делать только важное. Но долго находиться в таком состоянии нельзя. Когда мозг устает, начинаешь творить всякую дичь, не замечая этого. Уставать нельзя. Приходится возвращать с процентами."

          "content": "Trip properly\n\nWith the help of psychedelics and transformative thinking one can break out trough the shackles that are holding back. Then the life begin to truly unfold. You start seeing more in everything. And you are given the ability to mend what’s broken inside of you. Once you feel that feedback loop, the world starts changing in return.\n\nNot many tries left\n\nPsychedelic means manifesting psyche — mind, soul. They act differently, but the result is the same. You start seeing your thoughts. They become tangible and you can work with them.\n\nYou can change the world in which you actually live. The world inside your head. \nBut you can’t do it too often because the magic wanes. We don’t have that many chances to understand the world and ourselves. We need to make the most of it.\n\nTo maximize the effect, prepare diligently. Do the homework.\n\nTo infinity and beyond\n\nProper trip often is life-changing. If you are prepared, know what to expect and what to pay attention to, it might transform you on the spot. A comprehensive approach ensures safe and transformative experience. I’m sharing this for those interested in exploring brain-hacking techniques.\n\nIt is important to minimize the risk of bad trip and then reinforce the insights while they are fresh. You might get frightened or start freaking out. The best way to proceed is to just accept the experience. Whatever happens is only you.\n\nThe other common issue is nausea, which usually goes away, after a while. Warming-up and body reaction testing helps.\n\nIt helps to have a seasoned journey companion to navigate the experience. Someone who guides the trip and helps to find valuable insights along the way.\n\nThe best way to avoid a bad trip is to have a good one. Prepare mentally and physically. And have a guide. From experience. If properly prepared. With proper set and setting and a trip-sitter at hand. When\neverything goes as planned. Rebirth is practically guaranteed.\n\nSSS: Set, Settings, Sitter\n\n1. Set.\n\nFirst is the mindset. Approach this with eagerness to accept whatever comes your way. Remember, you’re only seeing yourself. I try to tune in by asking myself some philosophical questions “Who am I?”, “What do I want?”, “What do I do?”, “Where do I go?”, I’ll put up a list of for the self-guided sessions.\n\n2. Setting.\n\nSetting is time, space and the environment. I’ve found that early mornings in a remote, people-free location work best. For those who thrive at night, I suggest trying it alone outside during a full moon. So you don’t bang into something in total darkness. Prepare the playlist, only top-shelf golden tracks, no words. DJ Mixes work wonders. See the examples in (Music)[/music]\n\n3. Sitter. Trip advisor.\n\nIn a few trips you grow enough neurons to be always in control. I recommend the first breaktrough trip to be done with an experienced guide to help dive in and out. It’s important to record the insights while you see the world as it is. If everything goes super smooth — the guide melts into the background so you could concentrate on yourself.\n\nYou should start using your new abilities, while the gates inside are still open. Grow new neural connections towards them. The forward thinking, seeing things as they are, and the life control. This is why a coaching session is a must to properly integrate it. The questions start flowing in immediately. I’ll put a list too.\n\n\n  My next moves:\n    Phuket\n    Bangkok, Thailand\n  \n\n  A guided voyage through the landscapes of the mind\n  I change countries from time to time. Here are the places I'll be around the next full moon.\n  Full moon dates and locations for 2023\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          Moscow, Russia\n          \n        \n      \n      August 30\n      Blue Moon\n    \n    \n      Bangkok, Thailand\n      \n        September 29\n        Early October\n      \n      Harvest Moon\n    \n    \n      Mexico, Mexico City\n      October 28\n      Hunter’s Moon\n    \n    \n      Mexico, Cancun\n      November 27\n      Beaver Moon\n    \n    \n      Phuket, Thailand\n      December 26\n      Cold Moon\n    \n    \n  \n\n\nHere’s how I’d do it\n\nHave a few days stay somewhere not in the city, away from people. Secluded places are best to mentally decompress with no distractions.\n\nHave a cool-down and warm-up period. Start easing into the guided exploration of the neural constellations. Check bodily reactions to microdosing. And slowly turn the knob\nto eleven.\n\nFor the main event see The Ideas below. It should be mind blowing. With no other people around.\n\nThen unplug. Immerse in the experience of guided consciousness exploration.\n\n\n  We’ve lost the sense of wonder and transformation that used to come from initiation rituals and miracles. These\nexperiences were meant to be mysterious and beyond our understanding, in order to change who we are.\n\n\nIdeas\n\nI preach tripping outside so you can blend in with nature. The best place is somewhere far reaching. The best times are sunrise, sunset and the full moon.\n\nMusic has serious healing effect. The magic is in the frequencies. I plan to get the best portable sound system. Go\nto an inhabited island during the full moon and power it on. Hug the bass and feel the vibrations. Feel the magic.\n\nTake off at the top of a mountain. The sky is magnificent on a starry night. The morning clouds that spread below. The\ntip of the pyramid is the exit.\n\nWalk through the forest or a park in the night. See that the trees are alive. It takes a few hours so the track should\nbe long enough to see the tunnel of reality.\n\nWhy the Full Moon?\n\nYou can stay late outside and have some fun without risking your neck in pitch black darkness. With the healing magic of entheogenic spirit journey one can see the fabric of the universe under the moonlight. Depending on\nthe weather conditions of course.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be the full moon. I found Sunday early mornings works best. You need a day of integration anyway. And for the maximum effect it should be done outside.\n\nHow do I not forget?\n\nEnlightenment is like a dream. You wake up and it’s gone. You need to be asked question to remember. You need to be shown.\nCheck the section about common phenomena and what to pay attention to. It turns out that without knowing what to expect beforehand, people miss the most important insights.\n\nTop it off with the new self integration sessions. You need to master your new abilities. And learn how not to forget\nwho you really are are. Read the parts about what to think. I write about this too.\n\nThe planet is our home, and we do as we please.\n\nEach person deserves to see what else life on Earth has to offer.\n\nThe sands of time are slipping away.\n\nSo where’s the book?\n\nWorking on it! Stay tuned…\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  The Book\n\n    \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  Trip reports\n  Teriberka, North Polar Circle\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  Phuket, Thailand\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  Phang-Nga, Thailand"
